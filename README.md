Eisen &amp; Brown (2021) Ending animal agriculture would stabilize greenhouse gas levels for 30 years and offset half of anthropogenic emissions through 2100.

Animal agriculture contributes to global warming via ongoing emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide, and displacement of biomass carbon on the land used to support livestock. We calculated the climate opportunity cost of the consumption of livestock products by modeling the combined effects of emission reduction and biomass recovery on atmospheric greenhouse gas levels under food-system scenarios ranging from “business as usual” to the complete elimination of animal agriculture. We found that, even in the absence of any other emission reductions, eliminating consumption of livestock products over the next 15 years would lead to rapid and persistent drops in atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide levels, and would dramatically slow carbon dioxide accumulation. These effects would yield a 30-year pause, from 2030 to 2060, in the rise of radiative forcing, a measure of the warming potential of the atmosphere, and a reduction in heat accumulation this century equivalent to a 25 gigaton decrease in annual carbon dioxide emissions, over half of current anthropogenic emissions. The magnitude and rapidity of these potential effects should place the reduction or elimination of animal agriculture at the forefront of strategies for averting disastrous climate change.
